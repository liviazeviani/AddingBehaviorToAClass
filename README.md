# AddingBehaviorToAClass
An example adding behavior to a class

This example was used in **Java Programming Basics** by Simon Roberts - an O'relly course.


In this code it is possible to set a meeting date, with date, month and year.

But _how can we solve a problem when we need to change the date of a meeting_?
Would you add a day to the date?

What would happen if you had a meeting on February 28, 2023 and decided to move to the next day?

**February 29, 2023 does not exist!**

A feature needs to be added to implement this validation... that's what was done.
